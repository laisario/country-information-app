# Frontend Project - Country app

This is the frontend of the project, developed with **Next.js** and **Material-UI**. Make sure the **backend** is running before starting the application.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (or **yarn**)

## How to Run

### Step 1: Set up the Backend

Before running the frontend, ensure that the **backend** is running. Follow the instructions in the backend repository to set it up and run it locally.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Clone the frontend repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:laisario/country-information-app.git
cd country-app-frontend
npm install
# or, if using yarn
yarn install
```
### Step 3: Run the Frontend
After installing the dependencies, start the application with the following command:

```
npm run dev
# or, if using yarn
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Step 4: Verify the Application
Open the application in the browser and make sure everything is working properly.
Ensure the backend is running and accessible so that the frontend can make the necessary API calls.

### Technologies Used
Next.js: React framework for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and static page generation.
Material-UI: React component library for a more polished and visually appealing user interface.
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
